                    "Six snapshots from the pandemic years—when isolation forced us to confront what was really going on inside, and somehow we found ways to survive it together."
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Psyche Unveiled</strong> emerged from those strange, difficult years when the world turned inward. These paintings capture what it felt like to live through a time when everyone became potentially dangerous, when we were trapped with our own thoughts, and when mortality wasn't abstract anymore—it was right there, every day, on the news and in our nightmares.</p>
                
                <p>The journey starts with a scream—that first shock of realizing what the world had become. Notice the purple aura around the figure? That's the contamination zone we all learned to see around each other, the invisible bubble of fear that surrounded every human encounter. Then comes the explosion of being stuck alone with your thoughts, when isolation forces you to confront every anxiety and obsession you'd normally distract yourself from.</p>
                
                <p>The third piece might look like laughter, but look closer—there's a noose, there's pain, there's that moment when everything felt overwhelming and giving up seemed easier than fighting. But see how the hand pulls down on that rope? That's survival instinct kicking in, even when everything hurts. The fourth painting shows what comes after—the quiet, shell-shocked aftermath. It's about migraines that follow trauma, when the pain becomes so familiar it almost feels comforting.</p>
                
                <p>Then something shifts. The fifth piece breaks into something almost playful—an absurd scream or laugh that says "okay, if this is chaos, maybe I can dance with it instead of fighting it." It's that weird moment when you realize you can embrace the uncertainty instead of being destroyed by it.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, we arrive at direct eye contact—the first "real" human face in the series. After all the distortion and surreal elements, here's someone looking right at you. It's a thank you. An acknowledgment that you made it through something difficult, that you're here, paying attention to these deeply personal snapshots. The pandemic was isolating, but it was also something we all went through together. This last painting says: "Thank you for being here, for seeing me, for making this an exchange instead of just me talking to myself."</p>
