            <h2>About the Collection</h2>

            <p><strong>Still. Life.</strong> is an emotional and intellectual passage through concealment, struggle, growth, and eventual retreat — not in defeat, but in fulfillment. This series of nine mixed-media portraits is a spiraling reflection on identity, shaped by pressure, time, and cycles of blooming and withering.</p>

            <p>The journey begins in withdrawal: a reclining figure leans back, face obscured by their own body — a literal refusal of the gaze. The viewer is kept at a distance. In the next painting, a hand rests atop a bowed head, gently hiding it from us, both shielding and claiming. Then, in a gust of wind, a woman’s eyes are obscured by her own hair and scarf — movement without freedom. These early portraits are not about visibility but resistance: of being seen, of being defined, of being fixed.</p>

            <p>But this resistance softens. The fourth painting offers a still, blue pause — a quiet figure in contemplation, where a small flower begins to bloom. This moment marks a shift in the emotional atmosphere. Here, a sense of self begins to emerge — not boldly, but tentatively, and only partially. What follows is a study in symbolic maturity.</p>

            <p>The fifth work, drawn in colored pencil, shows us a full face at last. But it’s hollow, vessel-like — more like a ceramic planter than a living person. The sixth painting introduces levity: a skeleton in thought, surrounded by greenery, contemplative and wry. Growth, now literal, has entered the frame. From here, botanical motifs take over.</p>

            <p>In the seventh piece, a headless figure cradles a thriving plant, while a dry, twisted tree trunk emerges from the neck. The subject is no longer the seeker, but the mentor — the one who supports, who cultivates others. It’s an allegory of scientific work, where one’s labor often blooms most beautifully in someone else’s hands.</p>

            <p>The eighth painting is ceremonial: a crowned skull, regal and still, silent but radiant with achievement. And finally, we end in shadow — a heavily textured portrait with a flower on the head, receding into darkness. It is not a disappearance, but a chosen retreat, having left a legacy behind. The occlusion returns, but now it carries grace.</p>

            <p>Each piece in Still. Life. grapples with identity through what is seen and hidden, held and released. Faces disappear, reappear, and dissolve again — not to suggest loss, but to honor the transience of all selves: the apprentice, the thinker, the teacher, the witness. The still life, here, is not just an object of contemplation — it is a life that pauses long enough to be seen.</p>

                <h3>The Scientific Journey:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shy:</strong> A bald figure reclines with their face hidden by their own body — a quiet rebellion against being witnessed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frustration:</strong> Overwhelmed by your own thoughts in isolation</li>
                    <li><strong>Against the Wind:</strong> Facing the wind, trying to move forward, but held back</li>
                    <li><strong>First Bloom:</strong> A pale figure sits still against blue, a single rose emerging — a fragile moment of transformation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vessel:</strong> A hollow-eyed face rendered in pencil appears more artifact than person</li>
                    <li><strong>Hmmm:</strong> A skeletal thinker, surrounded by foliage, leans into quiet contemplation with unexpected warmth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Transfer:</strong> A headless figure grows a dry trunk from the neck while nurturing a thriving plant in hand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Laureate:</strong> A skull adorned with a floral crown sits in stillness — honored, silenced, and complete.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retreat:</strong> A darkened figure, flower-topped and fading into shadow, withdraws from view — no longer to be seen, but remembered.</li>
                </ul>
